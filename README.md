# deviat
Deviat takes a list of bin sizes and events per bin and returns a p value equivalent for the null hypothesis that the distribution of events is random.
deviat was originally described in Cirulli, E.T., Kliman, R.M., and Noor, M.A., 2007, Fine-scale crossover rate heterogeneity in Drosophila pseudoobscura, J Mol Evol 64: 129-135 (in Materials and Methods as "a randomization test'). 
We obtained the code from Mohamed Noor and rewrote it in MATLAB.
